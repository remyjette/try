TODO:

Make sure startup creates DB if it doesn't exist rather than failing
Multiple input boxes for student upload - they can submit multiple via .zip, but
  it would be nice to let them just select 2-3 files instead
Restrict student upload filetypes / number of files
Allow download / upload of test weights
Admin interface validation:
  catch sql add errors and show nice messages (unique constraints?)
    mostly done
  handle testfile no tests on upload or gradeall
  handle grader error on upload/gradealll
  cs3110_test module - cleanly handle Pa_ounit_lib.summarize () call

Grade all results - show test pass rates
Grade all results - show NetID of no-compile / timeout
Grade all results - tie CSV to session maybe? delete CSV at some point

Add Documentation

Add some sort of progress indicator to the 'Grade All' functionality
